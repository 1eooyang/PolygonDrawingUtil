# PolygonDrawingUtil

An efficient Android utility class for drawing regular polygons on a [`Canvas`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html).

Consumers can specify:

- number of sides (â‰¥ 3);
- center coordinates;
- outer radius (center to vertex);
- corner rounding radius;
- polygon rotation;
- fill/stroke [`Paint`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint.html).

This video was captured using the sample application in this repository. It provides convenient controls for exploring `PolygonDrawingUtil`'s parameter space.

# Getting Started

## Integration

1. Copy the [`PolygonDrawingUtil` class](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stkent/PolygonDrawingUtil/master/app/src/main/java/com/stkent/polygondrawingutil/PolygonDrawingUtil.java) into your app's source directory.

2. Update the class package statement.

3. If your project does not already depend either directly or indirectly (e.g. via appcompat-v7) on the [Android Support Annotations package](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations.html), follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations.html#adding-library) to add that package as a dependency of your project.

## Usage

1. Create a new `PolygonDrawingUtil` instance and assign it to a field in your custom view code.

2. Call `polygonDrawUtil.drawPolygon` in your `onDraw` method!
